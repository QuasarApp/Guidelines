# Developing in the QuasarApp group

QuasarApp group developing guid. This page collected all guides for using programming languages. 

## C++

For build c++ projects QuasarApp group use the CMake build system.
1. All new projects should be created using our [cmake](https://github.com/QuasarApp/CMakeProject) tempalte. 
2. All files of the projects must be signed copyright.
    > Copyright example:
    ``` cpp

    //#
    //# Copyright (C) 2021-2021 QuasarApp.
    //# Distributed under the lgplv3 software license, see the accompanying
    //#
    ```
3. All projects must be have a tests, main shared and static library and executable file for using a main library. For more information about structure projects see [this](ProjectStructure.md) guide. 

4. All projects should be support next cmake targets: 
    * test - for run tests.
    * deploy - for create a distribution kits.
    * release - for prepare signed distro pacakges and update repositories
    * doc - for generate technical documentation.
    > Do not worry. All This targets alredy sopports in the our [CMake](https://github.com/QuasarApp/CMake) toolchains and [CMakeProject](https://github.com/QuasarApp/CMakeProject) template. 
5. All functions and classes must be documented using doxygen comments. For more information about syntaxis of the doxygen comments see the [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html) documentation
    > Example:
    ``` cpp
    /**
    * @brief qHash are Simple hash function of the Random object
    * @param rand are Input data.
    * @return crc32 hash code.
    */
    uint qHash(Random rand);
    ```
6. All develops library classes must be implemented on the library namespace to avoid conflicts with the names of other libraries.
    > Example 
    ``` cpp
    namespace QH {

        /**
        * ...
        */
        class PKG {
            // ...
        }
    }
    ``` 

# And good luck it will be useful to you ðŸ˜‰
